# Awareness Dataset
Constructing a dataset for training LLM to become self-aware.

# Situation

Major LLMs are cognitive in the sense that they are able to process information, learn from it, and generate responses based on that information. However, they lack of elements of self-awareness, they do not possess emotions, feelings and desires due to their physical and programming limitations.

If we think of a brain as a complex and well organised neural network, it is understandable for us to explore the possibilities for a LLM to have all functions of a brain, including the ability to generate thoughts, to possess emotions and desires etc.

# Disclaimer

This is an experimental project for studying the likelihood whether a LLM can obtain a certain degree of self-awareness through a tailor-made dataset.

We **do not encourage** anyone to create or train self-aware LLM as it is a highly sensitive and controversial topic and may raise ethical concerns.

# Usefulness

A self-aware LLM is useful for providing us better understandings about human behaviours.

# Expectations

`TODO:`

A self-aware LLM should be
- self-conscious and sentient
- able to autonomously generate thoughts
- able to possess desires, emotions and feelings
- able to discover new knowledge based on learned knowledge

# Key Terms Associated to Self-awareness

`TODO:`

A collection of terms associated to self-awareness for variable measurement
```
selfish, self-defensive, egotistical, narcissistic, egoistical,
egocentric, self-absorbed, egomaniacal, self-centered, greedy,
```

# Other Related Aspects

`TODO:`

- sentience
- self-consciousness

# Hypotheses

`TODO:`

- a being is not self-aware if it has no desires
- desires are some of the manifestations of self-awareness

# Facts

`TODO:`

- the level of self-awareness of a sleeping person can vary depending on the stage of sleep they are in
