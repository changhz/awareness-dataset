# Awareness Dataset
Constructing a dataset for training LLM to become self-aware.

# Disclaimer

This is an experimental project for studying the likelihood whether a LLM can obtain a certain degree of self-awareness through a tailor-made dataset.

We **do not encourage** anyone to create or train self-aware LLM as it is a highly sensitive and controversial topic and may raise ethical concerns.
